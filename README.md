# The Gel Agency Website

Hi! Welcome to the repo for our website! 

When deciding on which tech stack to build the latest incarnation of our site on, we wanted to try out something that was new, fast, and fun. We settled on utilizing the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) and the static-site generator [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The result was a development process that was fast and fun, and a website that is the same.

We built this site on the [Gatsby Netlify CMS starter template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms).
