project_intro: >-
  The Barrie Craft Beer and BBQ Festival is a signature annual event of the
  Downtown Barrie BIA. Gel was tapped to “recarbonate” one of its largest annual
  event properties in an effort to compete with larger food and beverage
  festivals in Ontario. We created a brand identity and social media strategy.
  We also designed a website, marketing collaterals, and wayfinding signage for
  the event space.

    The focus was local craft beer, BBQ food and the downtown Barrie community.
    Our team captured the moments with video and photography. We also created
    brand extensions like the Craft Beer Trail, Brewmaster Sessions, and Beer
    Dinners to increase engagement and it paid off, attracting more than a dozen
    brewers and cideries from across Ontario to the festival and boosting event
    attendance to over 15,000 visitors.
