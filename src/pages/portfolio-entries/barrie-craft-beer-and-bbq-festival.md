  The Barrie Craft Beer and BBQ Festival is a signature annual event of the
  Downtown Barrie BIA. Gel built the whimsical website, designed the wayfinding
  signage for the event space, and created multiple brand extensions to leverage
  the events growing popularity.

    The Downtown Barrie BIA tapped Gel to “recarbonate” one of its largest
    annual event properties in an effort to compete with some of the larger food
    and beverage festivals in the province. The campaign paid off with more than
    a dozen brewers and cideries participating from across Ontario and in excess
    of 15,000 visitors passing through the gates.
