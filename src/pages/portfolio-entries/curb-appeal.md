project_intro:
  - The BIA hosts a sell-out premium outdoor dining event in Barrie’s downtown core each year. The BIA wanted to refresh the brand identity to reflect a more polished, upscale style and needed a new website to reflect the new direction. As part of the engagement, the BIA had Gel develop the event marketing strategy and work together to execute the plan.
  - Gel created the original brand for the BIA in 2013 so it was seamless for us to redirect the brand towards a more polished, sophisticated visual identity. A simple responsive site was built with Eventbrite integration to facilitate the purchase of tickets.
project_main:
  - We designed a multi-channel digital marketing campaign to raise brand awareness, generate demand, sell tickets, and attract sponsorship partners. PR, blogs and branded email and social media campaigns were designed with the hashtag /#barriecurbappeal chosen to encourage engagement. Under Gel’s creative direction, the event was captured by photography and video.
  - The event is a smash hit! Curb Appeal has sold out every year since its inception. With the success of the recent digital campaigns, the event has generated even more interest and attracted the attention of the media and big name sponsors, allowing the BIA to significantly reinvest some of the proceeds and give back to the downtown.
