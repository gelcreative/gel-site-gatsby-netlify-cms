  Mortgage Wellness Group is a fast growing brokerage specializing in
  residential mortgages. They reached out to Gel to guide them through a
  rebrand. Beginning with a brand exploration process to unlock the DNA and get
  to the essence of brand experience they wanted to share with their clients,
  Gel then redesigned the logo mark, built a complete suite of branded
  collaterals and ad creative. Gel also designed interior and exterior building
  signage.

    Our client wanted to reposition themselves as a first choice alternative to
    banks, rather than a lender of last resort. This strategic pivot would allow
    Mortgage Wellness to expand its target demographic, mitigate risk, and grow
    market share. They wanted to their brand identity to reflect the onus they
    put on providing a premium client service journey.
