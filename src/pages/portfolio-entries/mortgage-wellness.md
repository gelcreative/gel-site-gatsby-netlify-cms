  Mortgage Wellness Group is a fast-growing residential mortgage brokerage that
  provides premium client service. They reached out to Gel to guide them through
  a rebrand to reach a new demographic and grow the business. Beginning with a
  brand exploration process, we  unlocked the DNA, getting to the essence of
  their value proposition — the brand experience they wanted to provide their
  clients. Gel then redesigned the logo mark, built a complete suite of branded
  collaterals and advertising creative. Gel also designed interior and exterior
  building signage.

    Mortgage Wellness was at a pivotal point in the company’s evolution when
    they engaged Gel, repositioning itself as a first choice banking alternative
    rather than a lender of last resort. The brand discovery and rebrand
    achieved the result, elevating the brand and growing market share through
    new customer acquisition.
