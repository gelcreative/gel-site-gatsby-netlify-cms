project_intro: >-
  Natalie Scott, a Canadian business and life coach, was ready to establish her
  professional brand and to take it online. Gel took
  @theheartinspiredentrepreneur through our brand discovery process to bring
  clarity to her professional coaching business. Through several strategy
  sessions, we were able to unpack her “why” and helped uncover the brand’s
  essence.

    Gel built the brand identity, positioning and messaging and brought the
    brand to life in an elegant wordmark that expresses its essence. We designed
    and built a website that captures Nat’s infectious, positive energy,
    featuring custom photography. The work has raised brand awareness and grown
    the business, connecting Nat to her “SoulTribe” and winning her new
    clients.
