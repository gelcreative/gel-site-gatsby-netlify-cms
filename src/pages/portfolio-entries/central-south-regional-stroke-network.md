project_intro: >-
  The Central South Regional Network located at Hamilton Health Sciences hired
  Gel to design a visual identity and website to service their public with
  timely medical information along the entire stroke continuum of care. The
  brand mark was carefully designed with two primary objectives in mind; to
  clearly identify  the therapeutic area and to illustrate the regional
  interconnectivity of the network wide stroke care partners. Design elements
  such as the matrix within the brain were chosen as a way to communicate this
  important message.

    The website was structured and designed to provide its user groups with
    independent communications platforms. Unique content strategies and personas
    were developed for primary care providers, stroke healthcare providers and
    the general public. The outcome was simplified communication, delivering the
    right message to the right community member in the right context.
