project_intro:
  - The OBIAA is a network that represents, connects, and supports BIAs across Ontario. The OBIAA wanted a website that could do it allâ€”provide the resources member organizations need all in one place, build brand awareness and provide a frictionless experience for optimal engagement.
  - In addition, OBIAA was ready to level up the profile of their national conference.They needed an agency that could design a website that would elevate the conference experience online, expand its reach, and grow its reputation as a premier event in the industry.
project_main:
  - Working within the existing OBIAA brand guidelines, we designed a responsive website that does it all. The elegant design makes navigation seamless. A carefully architected members portal provides an intuitive user experience that, despite the comprehensive nature of
  - the content, makes it simple and easy for members to find what they need. We added graphical elements that align with the core brand using complementary colours and line drawn graphics to modernize the web experience.
project_secondary:
  - We designed a secondary conference website that integrates seamlessly with the OBIAA site so users can easily access conference information. E-commerce integration makes delegate registration frictionless.
