project_intro:
  - We jumped at the chance to build a website for Project Social—a visual brand styling and social company that began as a passion project. A company with a conscience, they host Social Events that connect the creative community while making a positive impact by giving back to community causes.
  - Gel designed and developed an elegant site that distinctly reflects the Project Social brand. Project Social started out as a page on the founder’s wedding planning site so it was important that the new site was differentiated for brand clarity yet aligned to ensure clients understood what Project Social was all about.
testimonial:

    Gel’s customer service, attention to detail, investment in my brand and my success, were all way above par. They took my thoughts and vision and turned it into something magical. They understood my needs. I HIGHLY recommend working with Gel for branding and digital marketing.
