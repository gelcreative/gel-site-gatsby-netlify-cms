  Electrolux Major Appliance is a manufacturing partner for the Kenmore brand of
  appliances. Gel developed the in-store collaterals to support the sales
  associates at retail. The work ranged from product catalogues to POS
  materials.

    With a crowded retail environment, Electrolux wanted to provide visual aids
    to help sales associates position Kenmore as the preferred brand. A litany
    of product specifications, along with features and benefits, were cleverly
    laid out in a format that was quick to reference, providing sales associates
    the tools they needed to grow sales at the POS level.
