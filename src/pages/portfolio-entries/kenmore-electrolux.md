  Electrolux Major Appliance is a manufacturing partner for the Kenmore brand of
  appliances. Gel developed the in-store collaterals to support the sales

    With a crowded retail environment, especially in the appliance categories,
    Electrolux wanted to provide a suite of selling aides to help sales
    associates quickly identify Kenmore as the go to brand to channel consumers
    towards. A litany of product specifications, along with features and
    benefits were cleverly laid out in a format that was quick to reference,
    providing clear and accurate information to any consumer questions at the
    point of sale.
