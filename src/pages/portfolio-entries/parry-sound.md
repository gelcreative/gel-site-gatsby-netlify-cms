project_intro:
  - The Parry Sound Downtown Business Association (DBA) wanted a rebrand that would convey their unique Georgian Bay roots, modernize the brand appeal, and express the sense of adventure and excitement of their locale.
  - The Parry Sound DBA serves its membership and community in the heart of Georgian Bay.
  - The Parry Sound DBA also needed a marketing strategy and digital assets to compete with other regions in cottage country. With many waterfront attractions and seasonal activities for tourists, the Parry Sound DBA wanted to attract cottage country travellers.
project_main:
  - Gel created a brand that expressed the iconic, rugged beauty of the Georgian Bay waterfront with a modern, civilized cottage country vibe.
  - We built a marketing strategy for the cottage country BIA that brought Downtown Parry Sound into the forefront of tourists’ minds. We designed a new website featuring a searchable members directory and calendar to promote their community events. A social media audit was completed and a social media strategy designed to position Downtown Parry Sound as the place to live, work and holiday on Georgian Bay.
  - The Parry Sound Girlfriends’ Weekend is an annual event packed with programming, shopping, and activities for women. Working in collaboration with the local Regional Tourism Organization (RTO 12), Gel created a Facebook campaign to increase brand awareness and drive engagement for the BIA’s popular Girlfriends Weekend.
  - The promotion resulted in an 80% increase in attendance and a 50% increase in revenue generated for the downtown businesses.

    I highly recommend Gel for marketing, branding, social media, and especially website design. Tom and Shannon were a pleasure to deal with and delivered a very comprehensive Brand Strategy and easy to implement Marketing Plan. The Social Media Audit outlined exactly what we needed to do to improve our social media presence. Gel built our new website and the end result is amazing.
