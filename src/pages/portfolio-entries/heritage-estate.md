  Heritage Estates Winery & Cidery produces additive-free beverages, uniquely
  crafted from 100% Ontario apples on the shores of Lake Simcoe just outside of
  Barrie, Ontario. Working with its existing brand identity, Gel designed a
  website to promote its line of craft ciders.

    Working with established brand specifications inspired by the popular
    series, “Game of Thrones,” Gel designed and developed a website that honours
    the heritage of this locally crafted cidery. Built to accommodate the
    expansion into wine and other brand extensions, the site allows for online
    purchasing of products as well as tour bookings.
