  How do you know when it’s time for a rebrand? The short answer is ‘it
  depends’, like everything—on your business, its legacy, the context, its
  leaders, the market, and most importantly, the current brand and your
  strategy. Here’s a question worth exploring as you contemplate whether it’s
  worth the investment of time and money as well as whether it’s worth the
  risk.

Can the current brand get you where you want to go? 

If the answer is “yes”, then you should stick with the brand you have, regardless of how tired or bored you and your team may be. If you think it can do the job, it’s not worth the potential risk of disruption and customer confusion. 

If on the other hand, you’re not sure whether a rebrand’s required, consider the following: 

1. **Outdated Brand** Does the brand look, sound or feel outdated? Has it lost resonance with your customers, prospects and audience? Market research can add objectivity to your gut telling you it’s time for a change. 
2. **Shift in Brand Strategy** Has the strategy changed? Offering new products, shifting the industry focus, expanding into new or broader geographies are all potential reasons to rebrand. Keep in mind your brand is the connective tissue between the company and the client. It has to tell the full brand story. If it only tells the chapter from earlier days or a couple of products, then the story’s incomplete. 
3. **Losing Market Share** If you were a first mover, there wasn’t much competition in the early days. Is the brand getting lost in the milieu of a more crowded, competitive market?  
4. **Merger, Acquisition or Sale** This is a complex circumstance with material implications primarily for the corporate brand. Often, the corporate brand with the highest equity is assumed by the lesser brand. Product brands can be affected by mergers and acquisitions, depending on the brand family architecture and how closely connected each individual product is to the company brand. Keeping the status quo for product brands is an important alternative to consider in this case, where the priority is a smooth transition and the goal is ensure the revenue drivers ie products/services are not disrupted.

So consider the intent very carefully – rebranding is not simply a creative exercise, but rather it’s a fulsome and rigorous process that ensures the visual brand language clearly communicates the organization's value proposition. And to realize the effectiveness of the rebrand, the consistent application of the visual brand language is key across all marketing channels.
