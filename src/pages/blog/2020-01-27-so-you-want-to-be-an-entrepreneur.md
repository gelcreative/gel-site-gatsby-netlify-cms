  Billionaires are good for business. Richard Branson and Sarah Blakely look
  like they’re having a good time. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are heading into
  space. What we see of the entrepreneur’s life looks appealing, but it skips
  over the gritty parts. Richard Branson running Virgin out of a houseboat
  paying himself £20 per week in the early days. Sarah Blakely packaging Spanx
  up in the living room of her rented apartment.

Most entrepreneurs find themselves somewhere between Sir Richard’s $20/week allowance and Elon’s spaceship to Mars. According to [Stats Can](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191113/dq191113c-eng.htm), entrepreneurs make up less than 3% of Canada's population. There are just 1.1 million active businesses, 65% of which are considered small (<4 employees). It’s an elite club for a reason. It takes a rare breed of person, some might say a certain kind of crazy, to take the leap. For the 97% of the population standing on the sidelines, I’m taking you into the locker-room to get an insider’s view of the entrepreneur’s life. 

**You enjoy the sport**. I know what you’re thinking. Business isn’t sport and the 97% of Canadians who aren’t owners would agree with you. But the 3% see entrepreneurship as a sport. See, it’s a game to us and games are fun. We lose some and win some, but we love to play the game. We take it seriously. We have skin in the game. For most of us, especially those of us who left corporate careers, there could be a Plan B if we wanted. We could always go back, but the difference now is that we choose not to.  We dust ourselves up and head back to the practise field. 

**It’s a contact sport**. Like hockey or rugby, entrepreneurs get beat up from time to time. It’s painful. Sometimes we push ourselves too far and have to take a break to recover. The smart entrepreneurs have good coaches and mentors, teaching us to pace.

**It’s a solo mission**. Chances are you have a small team if you’re like most of the owners in Canada. You’re not entirely alone — but the burden is on you. The pain and the pleasure is all yours. There’s gravity in that. It’s equal parts adrenaline and dopamine, much like a roller coaster, only it lasts a heck of a lot longer than 40 seconds. 

**You learn to tolerate failure**. Over and over and over. I’m not saying it feels good, but we’ve come to realize that failure holds great value. In those low moments we find our greatest insights, lessons, and breakthroughs. We have pity parties. The difference is they last a day or an hour. We shake ourselves off. An entrepreneur reframes failure into progress and quickly regroups and moves on. There’s no getting around failure. It’s a painful reality. 

**You like milestones more than finish lines**. This was a slow lesson for me. The finish line keeps moving when you run your own business. That makes milestones important. Most of us are too busy moving on to the next big thing to pause and celebrate, but the entrepreneurs who take the time to high five before jumping into the next are the ones who find the greatest joy. It’s the journey, not the destination. A truer platitude was never spoken.

**You’re in it for the money.** It may not be the only reason you’re in it, but it’s true. If you don’t want to admit that, you have some work to do. It’s for profit and if you want to beat the entrepreneurial odds, you need to make money. It’s a competitive game. We play to win.

**Hustle and rest**. I know hustle is part of the culture right now, but it’s unsustainable. Hustle all the time leads to burnout. I know. I’ve done it. I’ve learned that just like the farmer, you reap the harvest in season and then you rest. Likely not all winter, but you give yourself at least 24 hours before getting back to it.

**Pace, but don’t pace yourself.** This is what your mentors are for. Don’t trust yourself to set your pace. You’ll likely go too fast or too slow. This is where you lean on experienced entrepreneurs who have gone before you. They’ll see the warning signs. If you don’t have a mentor who is more successful and more experienced than you, go find one. Right away. Humility is an absolute must in this game. It’s impossible to know it all. Learn from mentors. Less lonely and more fun.

**Grow**. Lately I keep hearing “if you’re not growing, you’re dying”. This is especially true for entrepreneurs, no matter which sector you’re in. Even mature markets change. You need a growth mindset — learn, adapt, evolve. It makes you flexible. You can adapt to externalities and manage the internal ones. Invest in personal and professional development — books, coaches, conferences, courses. There’s no finish line. 

**You’re okay with co-sleeping.** This one took a while for me and it’s amplified by my being in business with my spouse. There’s a third person in the bed — your business. Only you can’t kick it out like a kid or a dog because it’s in your head. No wisdom here. Just a heads up.

**Introverted extroverts thrive.** This is a paradox. I know it seems like we’re meant to call ourselves one or the other, but I’ve realized the ultimate entrepreneur is a hybrid model. We’re extroverted — we can work a room, dial up the charisma to win a pitch, rally the troops after a setback, but we’re cranial too. We need to be alone, ideally getting out for long walks in nature, but more likely by wearing noise cancelling headphones on a flight or stealing an hour with the office door closed. This is essential. Time to work through a problem, sort through the clutter, see the patterns, find the next step. 

**Cynical optimists have a leg up**. Most entrepreneurs are optimists, but here’s the thing. Optimists don’t see blind spots. They assume things will work out. According to Medium, [cynical optimists have an advantage](https://medium.com/swlh/why-the-best-entrepreneurs-are-cynical-optimists-7382cb053ab3), and I tend to agree. So if you’re an optimist like me, find a mentor who’s a cynic. And the reverse is true. If you’re a cynic, hire an optimist. Yin and yang. 

**You need financial and emotional reserves.** There are seasons we must weather. Like a farmer filling the grain elevator during the harvest, the wise entrepreneur shores up reserves. The unexpected happens and lasts longer than we think. 

**It’s over when you die.** That’s the exit strategy. Yes, the fortunate ones are able to sell their business, but guess what? Most of them end up back in the game, in one form or another. The thing is, we don’t want to retire. It may be an unhealthy obsession, but most entrepreneurs our work as fun. We can’t imagine not being involved in business. 

If I haven’t dissuaded you yet, then I’d suggest you plan an expedition to somewhere cold to get a sense of what the entrepreneur’s life is like. Maybe the Arctic or a Himalayan mountain. Carefully pack everything you could possibly need and then remove about 70%. What you need at the start of the journey isn’t what you’ll need along the way. I’d replace that 70% with a steady supply of water, a roll of duct tape a wad of cash and your talisman. Entrepreneurs, we’re a little superstitious. We carry a coin or wear a certain pair of socks. We like to think it brings us good luck or goodwill, but really. I think we do it to make it seem a little more certain, a little less scary. 

So to all the entrepreneurs out there, I say, “I understand. I know what you mean. I get it. Me too.” Although  at times it can feel like a solo mission, we’re in this together. It’s an experience like no other. It’s the ultimate personal development plan and the best part is it’s only over when it’s over. You call the shots.
