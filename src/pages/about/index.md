about_intro: >-
  When we started Gel 15 years ago, we knew the type of agency we wanted to
  create. One that nurtures relationships, fosters creativity, innovates
  constantly, balances fun with profit and makes time for an "a-pint-ment" or
  two along the way. It’s our team of strategists, marketers, designers, and
  developers who breathe the creative intelligence into our campaigns.

      After 20 years of corporate sales and marketing in the pharmaceutical
      sector, Shannon decided to step out. Leaving at the top of her game,
      having been part of the marketing team that launched the most successful
      product in industry history, Shannon joined Gel as the strategy partner.
      She holds an MBA from the Schulich School of Business, a BSc in
      Kinesiology from the University of Waterloo and is faculty in the Georgian
      College Business and Management School. Shannon’s a blogger, writing about
      life, love, and tacos on the weekly.

      Tom is Gel’s founder. He is the source of the creative intelligence here.
      He’s the main reason our clients choose to work with us. He just gets it.
      He’s been an entrepreneur for over 25 years. He co-launched a startup,
      took it public, got squeezed out, bought an agency, and the beat goes on.
      Tom holds a BA in Political Science from University of Western University,
      and has public company Board experience and volunteer Board experience
      with the Downtown Barrie BIA. Tom’s that guy who plays any sport well, has
      mastered freelance cooking, and anyone who knows him knows he’s a die hard
      Leafs fan.

  heading: Our Approach
  text: >
    Our approach to marketing is different. It’s grounded in Creative
    Intelligence. This means starting every project, regardless of scope, with a
    strategy discussion before we start crafting solutions. We challenge you. We
    get to the root cause of your pain. We aren’t afraid to test your
    assumptions, to ask the tough questions and at times, to be the contrarian.
    This allows us to build better brands.


    Whether we’re helping you discover or refine your story, unlock untapped
    value in your brand to grow your business or trying new methods of
    communication to deepen the connection with your audience, we partner with
    you throughout the process so that we get it right.


    We invite you to explore our work, discover our culture and connect with our
    story.
