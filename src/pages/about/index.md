about_intro1: >
  Are we the right agency for you? We value long term relationships. We embody creativity. We balance fun with profit & we make time for an “a-pint-ment” or two along the way. 20 years later, we're still gelling.
about_intro2: >
  Our approach to marketing is our own — it's grounded in Creative Intelligence. Meaning every project starts with strategy, regardless of scope, then we discuss tactics.
about_intro3: >
  It also means we're not afraid to ask the tough questions. We challenge you. We test your assumptions and sometimes take the contrarian view. We want to fully understand your marketing challenge & diagnose the issue before designing the best solution.

      I've had my share of good fortune in business
      over the past 30 years—record-beating quarters,
      successful product launches, shattering a
      fundraising milestone, and the thrill of taking a
      company public. They say that fortune (I don't
      believe in luck) is where hard work and
      opportunity meet. I've also had some challenges
      in business. And so I should. That's undeniably
      part of the growth equation. The Creative
      Intelligence I share with our clients is the sum of
      these parts.

      I left a 20 year corporate sales and marketing
      career to join Gel & become an agency partner.
      While in corporate, I earned an MBA from the
      Schulich School of Business. As the strategy
      lead, I leverage my corporate experience and
      business education in all our client engagements.
      I teach Marketing and PR at Georgian College.
