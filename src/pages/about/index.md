      After 20 years of corporate sales and marketing in the pharmaceutical
      sector, Shannon decided to step out. Leaving at the top of her game,
      having launched the most successful product in industry history, and after
      managing many client side agency relationships, Shannon joined Gel as the
      strategy partner. She  holds an MBA from the Schulich School of Business,
      a BSc in Kinesiology from the University of Waterloo and is faculty in the
      Georgian College Business and Management School.

      Tom is Gel’s founder. He is the source of the creative intelligence here.
      He’s the reason our clients choose to work with us. He just gets it. He’s
      been an entrepreneur for over 25 years. He co-launched a startup, took it
      public, got squeezed out, bought an agency, and the beat goes on. Tom
      holds a BA in Political Science from University of Western University, and
      has public company Board experience and volunteer Board experience with
      the Downtown Barrie BIA.
