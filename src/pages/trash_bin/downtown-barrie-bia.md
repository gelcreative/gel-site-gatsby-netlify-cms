    We designed the brand identity system as the organization expanded,
    including a suite of individually branded events under the banner "Downtown
    Barrie Events." We enjoy providing event marketing services across the
    festival and connected event series. We are passionate about Barrieâ€™s
    downtown and delight in seeing our hard work come to life throughout its
    streets.
